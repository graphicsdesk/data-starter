# Data Starter

A starter template for data projects.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.
2. Make a new directory (`mkdir my-project`) and `cd` into it.
3. Run `curl -Lk https://bit.ly/2FfWVGM > Makefile; make;`
4. Run `pipenv shell` to start a virtual environment. (Here's a [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) if you're unfamiliar with virtualenv.)
5. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook server. A new window should appear. Navigate to `./notebooks/starter.ipynb`.
6. Start coding!
