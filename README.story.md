** Guiding question TK **

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have completed all the [Spectate prerequisites](https://github.com/graphicsdesk/spectate#prerequisites).

2. Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today) installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the directory.

2. Run `pipenv install` to install all the packages listed in the `Pipfile`. (The Pipfile is a file in this repository that keeps track of all the packages we want.)

3. Run `pipenv shell` to start a "virtual environment" (basically a shell within your existing shell) in your terminal that lets you access the installed packages.

4. We will be using Jupyter Notebooks to do this analysis. If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, I recommend watching [this short introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI).

5. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the notebook server. A new webpage should open up at [`localhost:8888`](localhost:8888).

6. Happy hunting!
